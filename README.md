# Pattern_Lab_project
This project is about evaluation of different models based on sentiment analysis.
### Objectives
Main objective is to evaluate different models using some machine learning algorithms.
worked on 6 basic emotions: Happiness, Sadness, Surprise, Anger, Neutral, Worry.
### Data Acquisition
There are two different dataset where we experiment our model for comparison:
* Tweet-Emotion 
* Go-Emotion 
### Methodologies
* Dataset Preprocessing
* Text Preprocessing
* Text Classification
* Sampling Data
* Model Evaluation
### Dataset Preprocessing
* Drop unnecessary emotions
* Add characters and tokens length columns
### Text Preprocessing
* Html parser 
* Remove punctuation 
* Remove non-ascii characters
* Remove stopwords
* Stemmatization
* Lammetization
* Tokenization
### Text Classification Models
* Random Forest Classifier
* Extreme Gradient Boosting(XGB)
* Support Vector Machine(SVM)
* Naive Bayes Classifier
* Logistic Regression
* SGD Classifier
### Result
For both dataset SVM model provides the higher accuracy.
